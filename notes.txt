Common CSS Properties
- color : sets the color of the text
    - set color:
        - words: red, green, blue, cyan, etc.
        - RGB: rgb(0, 255, 0) etc
        - Hex: #ff0000 etc

- background-color : sets background color of the text

- width : sets the width of the element - best practice
          is to set the width at 100% rather than pixels.
          use max-width if you want to set limit.

- height : use vh to set height

- border : sets the border of an element
            - 1px solid black; - go from there

- font-size, font-weight, font-family
        -   font-family: remember fall back fonts for browsers that don't support
            some fonts.

Specificity
    - The prioritization of the styling of the element.
    - When targeting a class, put a . before the class in the stylesheet
        - e.g. .red
    - classes are more specific than targeting an element
    - you can only have 1 id per item per page
    - use classes for everything except for sections. Use Ids for sections.
    - writing !important next to a property will make the element the highest priority
      on the page. --- try to avoid as much as possible.
